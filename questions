You have a CSV file named “New Institutes” containing details of applicants who have applied
for Institute approval.
Perform the following tasks using Pandas:
1. Design a MongoDB schema to store file details in a table and store it into Pandas Data
frame.
2. Populate the table with the same values as provided in CSV file.
3. Find the missing values in each field. If there is any missing value, try substituting it using
appropriate way.
4. Write a query in MongoDB to find out how many applications are from each state.
5. Apply Naive bayes and Linear SVM to predict possible approval of these Institutes. Also
compare the performance metrics of Recall and F1 score.
6. Depict a relationship between region and program using bar chart
